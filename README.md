It replies whith hard-coded sentences when a combination of characters is detected inside someone's message.  
For example, if someone send a message with the word "ayy" in it, the bot automagically replies with `lmao`

Another useful feature is that the bot can provide a direc link to any subreddit if we send a message containing "r/" followed by the subreddit name.  
For example, if someone send a message like "r/ingress", the bot will reply with `http://reddit.com/r/ingress`.  
A known bug is that the bot cannot recognise when a full link to reddit is sent: if you send, for example, "http://reddit.com/r/ingress", the bot replies with `http://reddit.com/http://reddit.com/r/ingress`, no matter what.  
We hope to splat it in the next major update, also implementing the same feature, but for 4chan boards.

This bot is hosted on Google Cloud Platform.
